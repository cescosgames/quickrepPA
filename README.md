This project features
1. Simple, and keyboard accessible layout
2. Straightforward delivery of necessary information

## Notes and Background:

This project was born when I stopped by a 'write to your representative'
table run by a civic minded individual. They provided great assistance to lots of people who wanted to get started writing to their representatives but did not know how, 
myself included! The first step of course, was to find your representative and I noticed that the offical government website was not mobile friendly and provided lots of
information that might not be necessary for someone who is just quickly trying to get the correct mailing address to send their letters to.
<br><br>
At the moment, this project does not have a civic information API to rely on to gather relevant information. Google Civic Information seemed to be the best option, but 
since it is being discontinued I did not end up implementing it in this version. I will continue to look into other options from which to gather the necessary information.
<br><br>
Right now, this project is fairly modular and can be applied to any state (or even all the states) by finding an API that contains representative data. All you have to do is
switch every instance of PA with your state (or USA) and connect your API to the main fetch request in Main.jsx (line 22). I set up two examples 1. using the data.json in the
projects public folder and 2. using the Google Civic Information API endpoint. You will have to then tweak the result depending on the structure of the data you recieve back.
<br><br>
As a stretch goal, I would like to add template current issue letters that users could copy and paste or print directly from the result screen. The goal is to make the 
process as frictionless as possible to get peoples voices heard, so anything that can make the process easier I would like to explore.

Thanks for checking this project out, I'm always open to improvement so any advice, comments, or criticism is always welcome!
